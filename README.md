# PatientMonitoring
The project aims to monitor the medical patient health data remotely. This includes the monitoring and alerting the respected person at the time of emergency.
There are a lot of problems associated with the services being provided to the patients.  
Internet of Things(IoT) has the potential in combination with communication technology with interconnected sensors data to provide health condition of patients.

Often hospitals do not fail to rescue however, they fail to recognize the vulnerable patients health on time. 
Also data collection of patients plays an important role for studying the health of the patient. 
Studying the data can help doctors for analyzing the health prospects of the patient.

In this system, the sensors are fitted in patients arm which will continuously monitor the pulse rate and body temperature. 
This data will be visualised on open source cloud platform(Thingspeak) which is accessible from any part of the world.
The system is integrated to collect data online continuously. 
This data later can be used to study and predict the possible health issues which may cause problems for patients. 
Also there is push notification service which will help to reach out doctors or nurses in case of emergency.
